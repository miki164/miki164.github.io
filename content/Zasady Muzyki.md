## Sounds
- Sound arises when source(elastic body) vibrates
- To hear the sound we need proper environment (e.g. air)
- Sound has few parameters:
	- Pitch - the greater the vibration frequency, the greater the sound
	- Volume - It depends on amplitude of sound
	- Duration
	- Timbre - it denpends on the amount and intensity of component tones

## Music notation
- To describe music we're using notes
- Notes have own time and pitch
- Sound have own name:
	- letter name
	- syllable name
- On the beginning of music notation we put the key
- The most used keys are C, G, F
- Key putted on the line means that one line is the sound C1/G1/F1

## Rythm
- The most basic note value is whole note
- We're getting smaller values such as: half note, quarter-note by dividing by two
- To extend the note we can use: dot, arch or fermata
- Unregular note values are creted by dividing note by other number than two

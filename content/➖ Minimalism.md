## What is minimalism?
Minimalism is idea that too many things in our live can lead us to:

## What we can do as minimalists?
Very basic thing is something called decluttering, it is... 

Next thing to do is making "Silent to do list", which contins every "message", which things in our environment sends to us. It shows which activities we need to do for things in our environment.

Minimalists environment allows us to shaping our space as we wish. This allow us to introduce to our live many new habits and give opportunity to be more intentional and focused on our live.

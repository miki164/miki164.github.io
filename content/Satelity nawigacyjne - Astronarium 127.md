# Satelity nawigacyjne - Astronarium 127
___
- besides of GPS we have Galileo system, russian Glonass, chineese baidu all are named GNSS
- Navigation systems use [Trilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True-range_multilateration)
- We measure time difference and estimate distance
- Satellites has onboard [Atomic clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock)
- We are using 4 satelites signals to correct reciver clock error
- We are also using support systems such as: [WAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System), [EGNOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System)
- [Theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity) affects on satellites so clocks onboard are correct
- We can use use navigation satelites to:
	- Measuring [Continental drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift)
	- Exploring earth atmosphere
- According to Krzysztof Kanawka satellite navigation will be useful in IoT solutions
- GPS is using also to spce vessels
- NASA wants to use nav sats on moon
- To navigate on the orbit we are using sats on the opposite site of earth, so signal is weaker
- We can assume that this signal can be useful on the lunar orbit
- For [Gateway space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Gateway) accuracy can reach 100 meters

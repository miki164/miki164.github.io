It's time managment technique, that allows to creating and ending [[ðŸŽ¯ Goals]].

## How it works
1. On the end of the day create six [[ðŸŽ¯ Goals]] to do on next day
2. Sort them by their priority
3. On next day start with the first one goal
4. when you complete one go to the next

**If you don't finish all tasks in one day, incomplete goals automatically roll over on the next day list**

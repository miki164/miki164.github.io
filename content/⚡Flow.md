# Flow
___
The flow state is the moment when I am fully focused on task and that what I'm doing. During the flow time slows down and I'm free from any [[ðŸ“³ Distractors|distraction]].

## Benefits of being in flow state
* Makes things more enjoyable
* Better [[ðŸ˜‰ Emotion regulation]]
* Greater intrisinc [[ðŸ˜Š Motivation]]
* Increased engagment

## Criticism
*...enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially negative effect: while they are capable of improving the quality of existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of life.*

I have to be advised about potential addiction

The flow connects with Japanese [[Ikigai]] [[ðŸ¦„ Inaczej]] p.56

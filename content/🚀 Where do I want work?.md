# 🚀 Where do I want work?
___

Hello! As you might know I'm only 18 years old (2021) and in next 2 years I will have to choose my carer path. This note would be more personal than others, so for you it's the chance to get know me better! Let's roll!

## My strenghts 💪
I'm a technological geek 🤓 I love programming and electronics. I'm an analytical mind. In fields of my intrests are science(especially physics), economics and electrical engineering. My main goal is learnig every day!

### Jimmy the space geek 🛰️
Since I can remeber I was intrested in new technology, but not in that 'normie' technology such as new laptops or new [[JavaScript]] framework 🤮, but something that would revolutionize our future e.g. [[🧲🚆 Maglev]], [[🔋🏎️ Electric Car]], [[🛰️ Cosmic communication]] and [[🔭 James Web Telescope]]. I found a [[🚀 Space industry]] as something stimulating my imagination and the field in which I want to develop my knowladge and skills.

### Jimmy the traveler ⛵
From childhood I was very intested in visiting places around the world and learning new cultures. As I growed I started to discover sailing. After that other ways to transport. I found so intresting questions: "How do people pilot a plane?✈️", "What types of trains we can find? And what that train signs mean?🚆"

## My weknesses 😬
Time to talk about the hardest thing-about my weaknesses. I have sometimes difficulties in contacting with people (That's the reason why you can find in garden many notes about psychology). I found subjects where I need memorize many things as boring and hard to me.

I have troubles with subjects like biology and chemistry(I have a suspicion, that's mostly due school and the way how I was learning that subjects)

## What my dream job should be? 🧑‍🏭
My dream job should:
* Be intresting, so should fit to my intrests
* Give me a way to develop myself and my knowladge
* Highly-paid (Everyone want that I know...)

## My possible career pathways 👣
### [[🚀 Space industry]]
Space is a multidisciplinary domain so I have here man pathways to choose.

The most obvious is being an [[🧑‍🚀 Astronaut]], although it's very elite job, so I have small chances ☹️.

I have many other ways:

* Electrical and eletronics enginner
* [[Avionics]] enginner
* Software developer
* [[Machine learning]] and [[Artificial Inteligence]] enginner
* Space scientist
* [[🌍 Earth Observation]] scientist
* Data scientist and analysts
* [[🖥️🔒 Cyber security]] specialist
* [[CNC]] machinist

### Programmer 🖥️⌨️
As I said earlier I love programming. I'm programming since I was 10 years old. I think it's easy-to-go career for me, because I have skills and experience in that field. Being programmer have many advantages such as: 💵 sallary, ⏲️ time flexibility.

### Other career pathways I'm thinking about
* Sailor🛳️
* Investor
* Airplane pilot

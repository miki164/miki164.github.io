# 📳 Distractors
___
Distractors are things in your environment which distracts you when you are doing things. When we combine many distractorswe will have a [[🔗 Chain of distraction]]

Eliminating Distractors is discussed in [[🦄 Inaczej]] and it's way to increase the [[🏭 Productivity]]

## My Distractors 👺 and how I'm trying to deal with 'em 🗡️
#### 📳 Smartphone
it's the biggest enemy of many people. Smartphones software are specially designed to attract our attention.

This devices make us harder to maintain focused on things we are currently do.

It cause also [Phantom vibration syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_vibration_syndrome)

Few tips to eliminate smartphones from live:
* Disable notifications 🔕
* Install software which monitor your activity on the smartphone
* Don't keep phone close during activities like eating, reading, learning etc. (seriously you don't need phone when you are on toilet 🚽💩)


#### Social media 👥
Social media are very good in distracting us. They are very addictive.

* Decrease your activity in social media
* Look how much time you spent online
* Decrease time on socials
* Try Social Media detox
* Be aware of [[Fear of missing out]]👻

What can you gain on social media detox? On my example I can say you will more focused, productive and relaxed. It's good for your mental health as well.

*I'm now facebook/snapchat/instagram free from 3 months! It's awsome! I'm using only youtube and messenger.*

#### Other people
I think everyone know the feeling when someone enters to your room/office and wants something from you. For example your parents wants you to eat meal... you propably thinks in that moment: "My gosh I've just started doing something productive". and after delicious meal your determination and creativity disapears...

For me personally it is very problematic distractor (living in one building/room with my friends), cause you have to find time for the people and when you want to be focused you need to be strong enough to say "Sorry we will talk later, I gotta do something".

I'm still tring to resolve that problem so I don't have many to say about that, maybe later.

## Distractor free environment 🌺
You can't create 100% distractor free environment, but you can try. Try to find your distractors and eliminate them. You could also try to enhance your focus through [[🌄 Mindfulness]]/[[🧘 Meditation]] techniques.

- The school methods of fast learning are not true: 
	- Coping what teacher wrote/said is non effective
	- Creating nursery rhymesis is ineffective and hard
- Very important is quality of our notes [Bednall and Kehoe, 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225856872_Effects_of_self-regulatory_instructional_aids_on_self-directed_study)
- We have to learn more and more to be up-to-date with still changing knowledge

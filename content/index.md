# Hello my friend from internet
I'm Jimmy and that's my [[🏞️ Digital Garden]]. I'm going to share my knowledge and thoughts
here. It would grow every day (I hope). Of course I'm inviting you to see
[github repo](https://github.com/miki164/miki164.github.io).

## How garden was built
It is build using gatsbyjs plus gatsby-plugin-mdx. Besides that, I'm creating markdown notes in obsidian. I
will be posting here everything what I'm learning. You will find here notes about software development,
psychology, hardware development, books (Disclaimer you could find here mainly polish literature :p) and many
more.
## About gardener
As I mentioned earlier I'm Jimmy. I'm 18 yo and I'm focused on getting new knowladge everyday! So that's a
reason, why I've created a garden. I'm a python programmer, guitarist and sailor. I love reading fantasy,
sci-fi, technical literature etc. My favorite lore is [SCP foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/)

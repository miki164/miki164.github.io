- We need to practice going out of the box
- What is outside a box is invisible for us (it's for us risky)
- Too make something creative is to add to something normal something absurd
- We need to go far with our ideas
- We need to be fluid and open-minded
- We have to resists things like: "Someone did it before me"
- If our environment punishes our mistakes we'll never go out of the box

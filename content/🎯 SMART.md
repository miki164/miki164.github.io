# SMART
___
Technique of creating and achieving good [[🎯 Goals]].

### SPECIFIC
Do you know what you exactly want? 

### MEASURABLE
Can you measure your progress.

> [[👁️Innattentional blidness|Be aware of too specific goals]]
> [[😶Goal neglected|Focus on main goals]]

### ACHIEVABLE
Can you achieve the goal?

### REALISTIC
Is goal real?
> Be aware of: [[📈Dunning-Kruger effect]], [[✨Iluusion of control]] and [[😊Optimism bias]]

### TIME-BASED
When are you going to do that? 
 
> Time shouldn't be too long or too short:
> - too short time force us to make work faster
> - too long time makes work longer and longer
> See [[⏲️Parkinson Law]]

Technically we can use only SAR. Specific, achieveble and realistic.

# 🏞️ Digital Garden
___

## What is it?
Digital garden it is your space in internet where you share your ideas or notes.

All entries to digital gardens could be navigated by links not in chronical order.

## Why is it garden called?
It's called a garden, because the idea (seed) I add to my garden, would grow over time like a plant.

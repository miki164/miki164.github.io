___

## What is it?
Digital garden is a personal space in internet where garden owner shares his ideas or notes.

All entries in digital gardens could be navigated by links not in chronical order.

## Why is it garden called?
It's called a garden, because the idea (seed) I add to my garden, would grow over time like a plant.

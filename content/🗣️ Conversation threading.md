# 🗣️ Conversation threading
___

Conversation threading is a technique that relies on following logical sequence of conversation.

When you're talking one topic create many more threads, which you can continue.

**For example:**
When someone said: "I was in cinema yesterday".

You can ask where is the cinema, which film he saw and many more.

It's good way to going deeper and deeper into conversation.

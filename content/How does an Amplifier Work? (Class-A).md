- Amplifier it's device to increase amplitude of electric signal
- There's many class of amplifiers (A, B, AB, C, D)
- Class A amplifiers have only one transistor
- The R3 resistor is add to separate output from Vcc
- R4 resistor is added to add an feedbeck to amplifier
- The amplifier gain equals R3/R4
- The R1/R2 voltage divider is added to add DC bias, so the input would be above 0.7 V

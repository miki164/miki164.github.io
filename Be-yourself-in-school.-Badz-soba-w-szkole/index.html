Bądź sobą w szkole</h1><hr/><p><em>For all of my fellow students, who have to waste their life in the school. And for those who want make school better place!</em></p><h3>🇬🇧 EN</h3><h5>Why am I doin&#x27; this?</h5><p>I&#x27;m a person who understand what is going on the lessons. So I&#x27;m often helps other students to learn on the exams. I see my friends how they closes on learning new skills, how they looses their confidence saying &quot;I&#x27;m stupid, because teacher said me that&quot;. I&#x27;m shocked and deeply sad because of that. Time to change it!</p><p>During our whole education in school we used to lose self-esteem, creativity and hapinnes! What we gain in exchange? Knowladge? 🧠 Friends? 👨Maybe. Although I think it is an illusion.</p><h5>Ilusion of gaining knowladge ⚛️</h5><p>Let&#x27;s start and think which knowladge is lectured in school? Boring, theoretical and outdated... Thanks to that we are immediately lose any motivation to learning. It affects after school time, because we&#x27;re simply to tired to learn somethin&#x27; unrelated to school.</p><p>With motivation we also lose confidence. We thinks: </p><ul><li>&quot;I&#x27;m not good in english. I&#x27;ve got one on last exam...&quot;</li><li>&quot;Teacher said I can&#x27;t do that. He&#x27;s right&quot;</li></ul><p>Exams and teachers creates our reality! Don&#x27;t allow for it❗We can learn anything what we want.</p><h5>Mistakes are our friends!!!</h5><p>This entire note is a big grammer mistake... As long as I remember I had problems with english, cause always when I&#x27;m talking on lesson teacher stops me because I pronounced something unproperly or I said something not grammaticly correct... This one mistake makes my grade go down. Teacher don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;m focused on saying this without any paper in contrast to my mates, who have ready answer on paper...  Teacher don&#x27;t say you made that very well. Gosh stop. This example is too big.</p><p>I&#x27;m 100% sure you have many exmples of being punished for your mistake. The true is mistake is key component of learning. You shoudn&#x27;t be afraid of mistake. Being afraid makes you less creative and makes learning process harder🪨School not even see this👀. It punish our every mistake, so we thinks we are less inteligent, we can&#x27;t do something and our self-esteem goes down 😥</p><h5>Exams. Don&#x27;t worry about &#x27;em</h5><p>School creates specific vision of learning. Where exam says how intelligent we are. Is it right ⁉️ Oh god sake NO. First of all we have many types of intelligence:</p><ul><li>An anlytical intelligence ➕</li><li>An emotional intelligence 😀🥰😂</li><li>An musican intelligence 🎶🎸</li><li>And so on and so on...</li></ul><p>It&#x27;s not even possible to measure all of that! Secondly if you can&#x27;t understand how to fraction natural roots by imaginary numbers (some random math shit) it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re unintelligent and you&#x27;re complete rubish. You can possibly be a genius biologist, programmer or even film maker ‼️ </p><p>It means:</p><h5>You creates yourself and your future SERIOUSLY ‼️</h5><p>School reality takes away our independence and decision making. We spend all days in school where we have planned lessons and we can&#x27;t change this. We can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t like this teacher and change him. We have to even ask, if we can go to toilet🚽... Thanks to that we think we couldn&#x27;t influence our future and take decisions!</p><p>That&#x27;s not true! When you end lessons you can take many decisions! Can you? Yes, but you are too tired to even thing you can do anything else than scrolling tik tok.</p><h5>How much time do we spend at school-related things?</h5><p>Let&#x27;s use magic of math! Here&#x27;s my lessons plan:</p><p><img src="lessons-plan.png" alt="lessons-plan.png"/></p><p>Now count how many hours I spend in school each day:</p><ul><li>Monday - 0️⃣6️⃣:5️⃣0️⃣</li><li>Tuesday - 0️⃣6️⃣:4️⃣5️⃣</li><li>Wednesday -0️⃣5️⃣:0️⃣5️⃣</li><li>Thursday - 0️⃣5️⃣:0️⃣5️⃣</li><li>Friday - 0️⃣6️⃣:4️⃣5️⃣ </li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s sum it: 3️⃣0️⃣:3️⃣0️⃣</p><p>Someone would say: you spend less time in school than adults, so shut up kiddo 👶.
Well, it&#x27;s time to go deeper... </p><h5>How much time do we spend at shool-related things in home? 🏠</h5><p>Huh the answer is complicated... For example I have a really flex approach. I&#x27;m trying spend as less time as possible on school. In last week:</p><ul><li>I helped my friend with english around 3h (I count it, because I was learing as well) 🇬🇧</li><li>I did an math homeworks for around 2h ➕</li><li>I was learning physics 2h</li><li>I helped my another friend with RTV around 1h 📻</li></ul><p>There&#x27;s now: 3️⃣8️⃣:3️⃣0️⃣</p><p>How much time adults spends in job, around 40 hours. It&#x27;s simillar time to me in school. Where is difference? Noone pays me for it 🙃 I can&#x27;t change the school. In many cases we don&#x27;t have a tools to take actions when our rights are broken.</p><p>Fast off-top there are organisations, which helps students fighting for they rights:
<a href="https://umarlestatuty.pl/">Stowarzyszenie Umarłych Statutów</a></p><h5>Illusion of gaining friends 👥</h5><p>Yes, we are meeting many people in school and yes they are becoming our friends. What ya thing, what if there was no school? I think we would have a friends. We are an social animals we have to have friends...</p><p>In todays world we loose basic social skills such as talking 🗣️ and working in groups 🤜🤛. I think it&#x27;s partially shools fault, but not only. It&#x27;s topic on new note!</p><h5>School tips &amp; tricks</h5><p>We said about school problems, let&#x27;s try solve &#x27;em. Through all time I&#x27;ve spent in school I found out the ways which helps me and other people find there ways through education system.</p><ol><li><strong>Don&#x27;t think about your grades.</strong> On long term it&#x27;s not important❗No one will ask you in your future work about your grade from biology in high school.</li><li><strong>Find what ya love.</strong> It can be everything singing, drawing or constructing flying machines. It gives you a happines and a goal.</li><li><strong>Don&#x27;t be afraid of playing and relaxation.</strong> People love playing and fun it&#x27;s nothing bad you love playing video games or talking with people. If you relaxed you are more efficent and happier! Maybe you&#x27;ll find your way in <a href="Slowlife" title="🐌 Slowlife">🐌 Slowlife</a> movement!</li><li><strong>Learn for yourself not for someone.</strong> Stop thinking about learning as obligation. You are getting skills for yourself. e.g. If you learn english you gaing a chance for better job or to make new friends in USA 🇺🇸</li><li><strong>Learn smart not hard.</strong> Way how we learn is often very uneffective! Start manage your time(<a href="Inaczej" title="🦄 Inaczej">🦄 Inaczej</a>) and change way how you learn(<a href="Wlam-sie-do-mozgu" title="Włam się do mózgu">Włam się do mózgu</a>) reading words and reapting them is wastig of your time. Seriously!</li><li><strong>Keep dreaming, keep changing.</strong> You can be anyone! You can do what you want!
